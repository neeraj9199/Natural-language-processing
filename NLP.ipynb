The only thing is the volume up button does not work, but I can still go into settings to adjust. Other than that, it does the job until I am eligible to upgrade my phone again.Thaanks!', 'I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2.', 'This is a great product it came after two days of ordering it. There was only one little blemish on the side,but who cares as long as the phone is fullly functional.i recommend this product to anyone reading this.', 'These guys are the best!
